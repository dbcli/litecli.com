**LiteCLI** is a user-friendly CommandLine client for SQLite database. 

<!--more-->

![LiteCLI][1]

It is based on the popular [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com) and [mycli](https://www.mycli.net) tools.

LiteCLI is written in python using the wonderful [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit) library. It is
cross-platform compatible and it is tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

It is developed by a team of core devs from around the world. The
user-friendliness is not just limited to the tool but the entire community is
friendly and welcoming to newcomers. 

The project is lead by [Delgermurun Purevkhu](https://github.com/delgermurun). The
core team constitutes [Irina Truong](https://github.com/j-bennet),
[Dick Marinus](https://github.com/meeuw), and [Amjith](https://github.com/amjith)
