## Python

See [Usage](/getting-started/usage) section to see how to launch `litecli`.

## MacOS (Homebrew)

In MacOS you can install it via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

    $ brew tap dbcli/tap
    $ brew install litecli

## Linux

Install via pip. We don't have RPM or DEB packages. If you're interested in making one, I'll be grateful. :)

## Windows

Python is not installed by default on Windows. The latest Python installation
package can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). When installing, select the 'Add Python to
PATH' option. Python must be in the PATH environment variable. NOTE: If Python
was installed into the "Program Files" directory, you may need to open the
command prompt as an administrator for the above command to succeed. Once
Python is installed and in the PATH environment variable, open a command
prompt, and install `litecli` using the below command.

Installation via pip

```
C:\> pip install litecli
```

See [Usage](/getting-started/usage) section to see how to launch `litecli`.
