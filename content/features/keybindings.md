Emacs/Vim

<!--more-->

There are two types of keybindings available. Emacs mode and Vi mode. This determines the various shortcuts that are available in the REPL. The keybindings can be changed via the config file (~/.config/litecli/config) or toggled via F4 key.

Emacs mode is the default. In emacs mode you can type `Ctrl-A` to go to the beginning of a line and `Ctrl-E` to go to the end of a line and many more. 

When Vi mode is enabled you can use modal editing features offered by Vi in the REPL command line. For instance, press the `Esc` key to go into the normal mode and from here you can press `$` to go to the end of the line or `^` to go to the beginning of the line.Press `i` to go back to the insert mode.
